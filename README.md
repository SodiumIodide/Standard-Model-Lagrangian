# Standard Model Lagrangian (Including Neutrino Mass Terms)

A LaTeX document (probably with more boilerplate than necessary, I used a default template generator that I wrote) containing the descriptive equations of the Standard Model Lagrangian of particle physics.

From _An Introduction to the Standard Model of Particle Physics, 2nd Edition_, W.N. Cottingham and D.A. Greenwood, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2007.
